"""Unified model interface for the Modular Arithmetic Challenge.

All submissions implement ``ModularMultiplicationModel``.

Pipeline contract (per problem ``(a, b, p)``)::

    a_enc = model.preprocess_a(a)
    b_enc = model.preprocess_b(b)
    p_enc = model.preprocess_p(p)
    digits = model.predict_digits(a_enc, b_enc, p_enc)
    answer = pipeline_decoder(digits, base=manifest.output_base, prime=int(p))

The decoder is implemented by the harness, not by the submission. Contestants
declare the base they want their model to emit answers in via the
``output_base`` field in ``manifest.json``. The decoder reads the returned
digits MSB-first and reconstructs the integer answer.

Each ``preprocess_*`` function may only access its own argument. Crossing
arguments (e.g. reading ``b`` inside ``preprocess_a``) defeats the structural
anti-cheat design and is checked by the pipeline.
