# Modular Arithmetic Challenge

Can a neural network learn modular multiplication efficiently?

Given two large integers `a`, `b` and a prime `p`, compute `(a * b) mod p`. Operands can be hundreds of digits long — far beyond what fits in a 64-bit integer. Your model must **learn** to compute the answer — the answer must come from trained parameters, not from symbolic-math libraries, Python's built-in arbitrary-precision arithmetic, or an arithmetic algorithm hand-coded over the inputs (in Python **or** tensor operations). Submissions implement a narrow interface (three per-argument preprocessing hooks plus `predict_digits` returning the answer as base-`b` digits); the harness-provided decoder does the rest. See [rules/overview.md](rules/overview.md#prohibited-practices) for the precise rules.

See **[rules/overview.md](rules/overview.md)** for full competition rules, background, scoring, and submission workflow. For evaluation details (sandbox, test generation, time and resource budgets) see **[rules/evaluation.md](rules/evaluation.md)**, and for related prior work see **[rules/literature.md](rules/literature.md)**.

This repository contains the open-source evaluation system used for both local testing and official evaluation.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install torch  # required for example models

# Run example models from examples/examples.json (private models via HF token)
modchallenge evaluate-example --group private --total 110

# Evaluate a single HuggingFace submission
modchallenge evaluate-hf user/my-model <commit_hash> --token hf_xxx

# Quick-test any HuggingFace LLM (exploratory, not ranked)
modchallenge evaluate-llm Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Difficulty Tiers

11 tiers. Tier 0 is a diagnostic (pure multiplication, unscored). Tiers 1-10 are scored.

Each tier independently controls both the prime size and the operand size. Operands grow progressively across tiers, so every tier tests a distinct combination of multiplication scale and modular reduction complexity.

| Tier | Prime p (bits) | Operands a, b (bits) | ~Decimal digits of a, b |
|------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 0    | diagnostic    | 1-4096               | 1-1233 (10 sub-levels)  |
| 1    | 1-3           | up to 32             | up to 10                |
| 2    | 4-8           | up to 48             | up to 15                |
| 3    | 9-16          | up to 64             | up to 19                |
| 4    | 17-32         | up to 96             | up to 29                |
| 5    | 33-64         | up to 128            | up to 39                |
| 6    | 65-128        | up to 256            | up to 77                |
| 7    | 129-256       | up to 512            | up to 154               |
| 8    | 257-512       | up to 1024           | up to 309               |
| 9    | 513-1024      | up to 2048           | up to 617               |
| 10   | 1025-2048     | up to 4096           | up to 1233              |

Tier 0 covers the full operand range (10 sub-levels from 1-digit to 1233-digit) as pure multiplication without modular reduction. This allows diagnosing whether a model fails at high tiers due to multiplication capacity or modular reduction ability.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `modchallenge evaluate <dir>` | Evaluate a local submission directory |
| `modchallenge evaluate-hf <repo> <hash>` | Evaluate a HuggingFace submission (trusted-use only, no sandbox) |

## Test Generation

- Master seed: `secrets.token_bytes(32)` (secret) or fixed (public benchmark)
- Per-tier seeds derived via `HMAC-SHA256(master_seed, tier_id)`
- 5 different primes per tier to prevent overfitting
- Edge cases: a=0, b=0, a=1, b=1 in every tier
- Public benchmark uses a fixed seed so results are reproducible

Note: this bibliography is not intended to be comprehensive. Some of the papers study the "grokking" phenomenon that can occur for very small moduli, but this phenomenon may not necessarily be applicable to the medium-sized moduli considered in this competition.
